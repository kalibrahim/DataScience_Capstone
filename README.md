# Spotify Song Recommender
Recommending songs based on my music taste.

## Installation
I am using Python 3.7.3 and Anaconda for this project. You can use requirements.txt file with pip to install all dependencies. 
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Motivation
The purpose of this project is to understand song recommendation engines, by using Spotify's API to pull track features and recommend based on my music taste.

## Files
This repo contains:
* Spotify-recommender-udacity-capstone.ipynb
* requirements.txt
* README.md

## Summary
The following models were used to predict my music taste, order from the best to worst:
1 - XGBoost
2 - KNN
3 - Random Forest
4 - Decision Tree
5 - Logistic Regression

This project allowed me to explore both of passions: music and ML. I got learn a lot about Spotify's feature extraction from using their API. There was a lot googling done to help me write up this notebook and that is what's going to help me in my future job as a Data scientist. I would like to thank Udacity for this oppurtunity, because I wouldn't made the decision to go with this project in the first place.
